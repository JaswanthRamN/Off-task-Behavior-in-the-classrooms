## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **off-task behaviors** in classrooms to enhance student engagement and improve learning outcomes. The study investigates how distractions and off-task behaviors impact student performance and classroom dynamics using an "off_tasks.csv" dataset with **22 columns** and **27,731 rows**.

### Key Objectives:
- **Identify and analyze** off-task behaviors to understand their correlation with classroom activities and student engagement.
- **Use data-driven approaches** like **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **machine learning** to predict and mitigate off-task behavior.
- **Provide actionable insights** for educators, school administrators, and policymakers to enhance classroom environments and improve student focus.

### Methodology:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Remove outliers, handle missing data, and prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilize statistical analysis, heatmaps, and visualizations (scatter plots, box plots, bar charts) to discover patterns and relationships in the data.
3. **Machine Learning Models**: Implement models such as **Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to predict off-task behavior and evaluate their performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### Expected Outcomes:
- A better understanding of classroom behaviors and the factors contributing to off-task actions.
- Predictive models capable of forecasting off-task behavior, helping educators intervene early.
- **Recommendations** based on data insights to improve student engagement, optimize teaching methods, and reduce disruptions in the classroom.

This study leverages **data science** and **machine learning** to offer **evidence-based solutions** for improving classroom environments, fostering more productive and engaged learning experiences for students.
